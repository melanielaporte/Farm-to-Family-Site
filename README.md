<h1 align="center">Website UX/UI Case Study: Farm to Family</h1>

## Overview  
Farm to Family is a fictional nonprofit dedicated to making farm-fresh produce accessible through a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program. The goal of this project was to design and develop an engaging, user-friendly website that effectively communicates their mission and streamlines user actions such as sign-ups and donations.  

I **designed and fully coded** this project, handling both UX/UI and front-end development.

## Problem Statement  
- **Cluttered Information Architecture:** Users struggled to find relevant program details.  
- **Ineffective Calls to Action (CTAs):** Unclear how to sign up or support the nonprofit.  
- **Lack of Visual Appeal:** Outdated aesthetics failed to inspire engagement.  
- **No Mobile Optimization:** The original layout did not adapt well to different screen sizes.  

## Goals  
- Design a clean, modern, and engaging UI.  
- Improve navigation and structure for better usability.  
- Optimize for mobile responsiveness.  
- Create clear, action-driven CTAs.  

## Research & User Flow  
Through a usability audit and wireframing in **Figma**, I restructured the site's information hierarchy:  
✔ **Intuitive Navigation:** Simple, logical menu categories.  
✔ **Clear CTA Buttons:** Prominent "Join the CSA" and "Donate" buttons.  
✔ **Streamlined Content Layout:** Focused messaging to reduce cognitive overload.  

## Wireframes & Visual Design  
Using **Figma**, I developed wireframes and high-fidelity mockups, focusing on:  
- **Earthy, warm color palette** reflecting farm-fresh values.
- **Clear visual hierarchy** to highlight key information.
- **Imagery & icons** that enhance storytelling and engagement.

## Usability Testing & Refinements  
I conducted usability testing with five users, leading to:  
- Improved CTA button visibility and placement.
- Increased font contrast for better readability.
- Optimized mobile layout based on real-world device testing.  

## Development & Implementation  
I coded the final site using:  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the front-end.  
- **Responsive design techniques** to ensure seamless display on all devices.  

## Results & Impact  
- Improved user engagement and navigation.
- Faster page load times with optimized visuals.
- Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile users.  

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates my ability to bridge **UX/UI design and front-end development**—from research and wireframing in **Figma** to full implementation in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
